# vue-type-checker

I followed the tutorial here: https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-typing-speed-effect-with-vuejs456 and created the project in VueJS.  Then I realized it wasn't tracking errors after the first one.  I wanted to teach myself more VueJS and Javascript so I figured it out and added in that ability.
